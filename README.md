Specialty Orange Analysis and Code for CRB project

This is the code that I am writing to use for a project I undertook at UC Davis during 2018-2019 which involved evaluating chemical,
descriptive, and consumer testing for specialty varieties of oranges, including varieities such as Cara Cara, Boukhobza, Sanguinelli,
Moro, and Tarocco. Code pieces include the analyses that I am currently working on.
